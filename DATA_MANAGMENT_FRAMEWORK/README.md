## Dataset management for deep learning applications

Introducing Data 2.0, powered by Hub.
The fastest way to store, access & manage datasets with version-control for PyTorch/TensorFlow. Works locally or on any cloud. Scalable data pipelines.

### What is Hub for?

Software 2.0 needs Data 2.0, and Hub delivers it. Most of the time Data Scientists/ML researchers work on data management and preprocessing instead of training models. With Hub, we are fixing this. We store your (even petabyte-scale) datasets as single numpy-like array on the cloud, so you can seamlessly access and work with it from any machine. Hub makes any data type (images, text files, audio, or video) stored in cloud usable as fast as if it were stored on premise. With same dataset view, your team can always be in sync.

Hub is being used by Waymo, Red Cross, World Resources Institute, Omdena, and others.

### Features

1. Store and retrieve large datasets with version-control
2. Collaborate as in Google Docs: Multiple data scientists working on the same data in sync with no interruptions
3. Access from multiple machines simultaneously
4. Deploy anywhere - locally, on Google Cloud, S3, Azure as well as Activeloop (by default - and for free!)
5. Integrate with your ML tools like Numpy, Dask, Ray, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
6. Create arrays as big as you want. You can store images as big as 100k by 100k!
7. Keep shape of each sample dynamic. This way you can store small and big arrays as 1 array.
8. Visualize any slice of the data in a matter of seconds without redundant manipulations
